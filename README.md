This project is a Weather Application built with Flask that allows users to search for any city and view current weather conditions.
It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time data, including:

ðŸŒ¡ Temperature (Â°C)

ðŸŒ¤ Weather condition & description

ðŸ’§ Humidity levels

ðŸŒ¬ Wind speed

The interface is built with Bootstrap for a modern, responsive design. Users can enter a city name, and the app displays the weather information in an elegant card layout. Invalid searches return clear error messages.
